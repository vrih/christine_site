Story Deli / Storybox at the Scooter Shop
 

The Story Deli / Storybox Pizza Cafe at the Scooter Shop is back and boy am I glad or am I glad? 
 

Casting my mind back to the uni years, I really did spend a hella lot of time loitering around Brick Lane. Those were the good old bad old days. I remember seeing [Jamie Woon](http://www.jamiewoon.com/) at The Vibe Bar when he was relatively unknown and being enamoured by him and his ability to single-handedly stun the entire audience into silence with his luminous voice and a [Line 6 DL4 Stompbox Modeler](http://line6.com/stompboxmodelers/index.html). I remember summer days turning into long nights out, leading to chewing far too many salt beef and mustard bagels instead of death by curry at midnight.
 

While I'm at it, let's not forget spending quite a few bob in Rough Trade East after spending what seemed like hours, trying to listen to as many new records as possible before closing time. Story Deli used to be opposite Rough Trade East and it kept my friends and I happily fed for many years. After leaving university and moving fairly far away, there was a dry spell where I basically would not touch pizza or anything that resembled it for approximately 2 years. This is almost certainly down to my sweet memories of eating fresh, wholesome pizza's at Story Deli, mostly topped with garlic and thyme roasted mushrooms, buffalo mozzarella and mascarpone. I refused to settle for any pizza's that weren't at least as good as those from Story Deli.
 

Very recently there was a sudden urge to seek out a Story Deli Pizza. I nearly cried when I found that it no longer existed on Dray Walk.. By a stroke of luck, this was quickly remedied as it became apparent that they were in the process of relocating. I was fully consoled after being reunited with the delightful Story Deli and the ethereal beauty of Ann Shore's interiors.. And so the story continues...
