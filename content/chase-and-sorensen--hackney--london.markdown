Chase & Sorensen

*Nobody does 'chill' quite like Chase & Sorensen*

In
[February 2012, I mentioned this neat and tidy little place in Hackney](http://intotheglorybox.com/contain-control-contentment.html). In
fact, I could hardly contain myself as I was so sure it would turn out
to be one of my main discoveries of the year. There was no way I was
going to let any other coffee shop surpass the level of excitement I
felt so strongly after visiting the beautiful Chase & Sorensen. Since
then, I visited a number of retreats that were all kinds of good, but
none of them made me feel so at home like this one did. There is no
place quite like it (but if you can prove me wrong, I want to
know). First of all, it's not strictly a coffee shop, although I know
of a few people who would happily lounge around in there for the best
part of a day. There will be lots of empty cups and most likely even
more empty plates if the cake is as good as I remember it. If you like
open sandwiches, Chase & Sorensen have got it covered. You might also
be interested in... Sweets (in abundance), vintage leather satchels
(while stocks last), glass, teak and ceramic objects of desire (if
you're lucky), clocks, containers and lamps to add a little character
to your humble abode. Above all, if you can appreciate modern Danish
furniture, then Chase & Sorensen might just be for you.

This is the idea I wish I had thought up and carried through. This is
the coffee shop I wish I had opened. Not just because that would
involve making several trips back and forth to Denmark and not just
because it is located a stone's throw away from the house I spent a
great deal of my childhood in. Chase & Sorensen have worked hard to
maintain this business and project as a welcome addition to the local
neighbourhood, as well as further and farther afield. As far as I'm
concerned, Chase & Sorensen remains as sweet as can be. If they
continue to take steps in the right directions, we might even be
blessed with a few brother or sister shops in other areas and I'm all
for it. Now that's a family I'd like to be part of.
