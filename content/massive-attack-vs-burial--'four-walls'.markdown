I just can't stress enough how much Massive Attack has shaped my
life. Seeing them at the Docklands London Arena (circa 1998..) was an
all time highlight. For me, there aren't many music makers that come
close to being as consistently able to capture that all important
(often cinematic) moodiness, creating a sound so instantly
recognisable as theirs in their own right. What more is there to say
about Burial that hasn't already been said? If you like atmospheric
electronic music then this remix will be worth a listen or two. If
not, then all you need to know is that there probably isn't a single
electronic music producer out there who hasn't been influenced by
Massive Attack +/- Burial and there are plenty more who wish they
could captivate their listeners as profoundly as these progenitors
have done over the long haul.
