*'It's Not Over' by Panama* 
 
Video shot in Berlin and directed by Fabian Rottger and Vivien Weyrauch
 
Out on November 2nd 2012 via Future Classic 
 
Somebody once told me it's much harder to produce music of the bright
and happy kind than the dark, moody and mournful sounds I used to be
fixated on. Seemingly, this does not apply to Future Classic's
recently signed Sydney outfit - Panama - who make it look so
easy. Listen again and you can hear the amount of passion and skill it
has taken to light up the room. Jarrah McCleary's five-piece band
proves that a little positivity and striving for musical perfection
goes a long way.
