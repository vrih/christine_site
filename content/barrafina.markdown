Barrafina - London - Grilled Artichokes and Aioli
 
 
Trust me on this one, you don't want to miss out on the oh so fine and ever popular Barrafina Tapas Restaurant and Bar. Barrafina, I dream of you. 
 
 
My hopes are high for the opening of a second Barrafina from brothers Sam and Eddie Hart on 43 Drury Lane in Covent Garden.
