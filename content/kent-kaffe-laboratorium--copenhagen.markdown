Kent Kaffe Laboratorium - Copenhagen
 

Denmark knows coffee. Actually, that's an understatement. Rarely does a year go by without a Barista from Denmark being named top 5 in the world. In fact, the only countries that drink more coffee are their Nordic neighbours. 
 

Kent Kaffe Laboratorium has a mission. This mission is to teach people the wonder of black coffee and Kent Kaffe is almost all about the bean. It was the first place we visited in Copenhagen and really speaks of the quality and pride that you find throughout the city. We ordered two coffees brewed in a Hario V60. Not content with just giving us two identical coffees, our welcoming Barista presented us with a cup of dark and medium roasted coffee, both from the same organic, fair trade Ethiopian bean. Whether you want to or not, you will leave this cafe more knowledgeable and grateful for it. 
 

In London, until recently, there were really only two main roasteries - Square Mile Coffee and Monmouth Coffee. In Copenhagen it seems like almost every coffee shop has their own in-store roaster. Kent Kaffee Laboratorium has not only a small in-store roaster for small batches but also a separate roastery. The roastery actually came first and the shop is a store front to promote the beans and educate people in how to get the best out of them.
 

To some of the Danish, instant coffee is unheard of. I don't blame them. Why would they cut corners like that? The perfect cup of filter coffee takes five minutes to make from grinding to drinking, less for an espresso. With so many expert coffee makers in Copenhagen, the coffee shops are just the best of the best. This also means that the shops are meccas of coffee paraphernalia for home brewing. In Kent Kaffe Laboratorium you'll find a wall lined with bags of freshly roasted beans as well as what must be the complete [Hario](http://www.harioglass.com/coffee/index.html) range for making coffee, including syphons and filters that would make a Nobel prize winning chemistry lab jealous.
