Rhossili Bay
 
Try as I might, I can't quite seem to capture the beauty of Rhossili Bay to its full extent. Those of you who've made the journey there will have been rewarded with breathtaking views and an immense feeling of hope for the world as areas of outstanding natural beauty like this continue to remain untouched. This is the first place I took my other half to impress him early on in our relationship. I'm pretty sure he was impressed. There were no complaints.
