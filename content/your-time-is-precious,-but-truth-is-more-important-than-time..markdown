As the year 2012 comes to an end, it's time for me to jot down a few
notes to share with you. The last few months have been fairly testing
and it's safe to say that I only just managed to emerge from this game
of endurance unscathed. A series of eventful moments made me realise
just how precious time is (how silly of me to think I could waste it
wisely). On top of that, the most important lesson learnt was to
surround yourself with the best people. I can not stress this
enough. I consider myself extremely lucky to have worked with some
outstanding teams and individuals. Only good things have ever come out
of this. It is also a blessing that I have crossed paths with many
passionate, innovative and masterful individuals from professions
other than my own. All of this has given me the courage and
inspiration to design my life the way I want to live it. Witnessing
the high standards set and maintained by many of the people I have
come across this year has been eye-opening and encouraged me to dig a
little deeper. Of course, I'm aware there's much work to be done, but
I'm not afraid of this because all it means is that I'll be that much
closer to fulfilling those wild and beautiful dreams of mine.


The following people and places brought me buckets of happiness this
year. These were chosen because, on every occasion that I encountered
or visited, I got the feeling that they were not just having another
good day, but a blooming great day everyday. It's my hope that you
will pay them all a visit or purchase a record/event ticket and show
as much warmth as possible. I trust that this will bring out that star
quality many of you seek out. Besides, it will help to ensure that
they keep on having great days and prosperous times ahead. It really
does work both ways and I can assure you that I've lost count of the
number of times these people and places have brightened up my
day. Truthfully, I can't thank them enough for making my year that
much better.


**The sounds:**


- [Maya Jane Coles](http://mayajanecoles.com/) - there's nothing about
this girl that I would change and this stretches from her
[selection skills](http://www.dj-kicks.com/mayajanecoles-dj-kicks/),
right down to her icy cool productions and remixes, not forgetting
that she does all this with the utmost grace.

{% soundcloud 60481962 %}

 - The sounds in [Youandewan](https://www.facebook.com/Youandewan)'s
   head. I wish I could hear them. Fortunately, we can get a good
   taste of this through his work, which continues to go from strength
   to strength.

{% soundcloud 31344246 %}

- [Claro Intelecto](http://www.claro-intelecto.com/)'s Reform Club -
  ['It's Getting Late'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkDfFB2ZAFQ)
  getting me through all those late nights I wish I'd never had, the
  morning after. This is music production of a different class.
- [Kyle Hall](http://wildkyleoats.com/)'s 'I Love Dr. Girlfriend'
  (actually released in 2008) is a testament to his prolific
  production skills, which remain forever true to his own style and
  the city of Detroit. I'd love to know the
  [full story behind this track](http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1116).

{% soundcloud 32602442 %}

- [Sven Weisemann](http://www.svenweisemann.com/) - I would describe
  him as someone who doesn't just scratch the surface. He's certainly
  a thinking woman's/man's DJ/producer. Failing that, you'll just be
  dancing hard. No matter which way I look at him, he's like a win-win
  situation by definition.

{% soundcloud 49657344 %}

- [Junior Boys](http://juniorboys.net/) - sounded fantastic at their
  London gig this year. Blown away doesn't cover it. Eagerly awaiting
  the release of new material now (e.g. 'Don't You Know Anything?')
  and have been for a while.
- [Daughter](http://www.ohdaughter.com/) - performers and makers of
  mesmerising music.
- No you can't escape from Lana Del Rey. But, you can listen to this
  compelling remix of Born To Die by
  [Two Armadillos](https://soundcloud.com/two-armadillos). Deeply
  poignant. Rest well, Martin Dawson.

**The flowers:**

That Hattie Fox from
[That Flower Shop](http://www.thatflowershop.co.uk/), she is rather
good at what she does. For all your floral needs - and for some, those
needs reach almost dangerous levels - you should contact Hattie or pay
her a visit at [Netil Market](http://netilmarket.tumblr.com/) on
Saturdays. Can I call her a wizardess? Sorceress doesn't sound
right. I think you get the picture. If not, please understand that
your wedding or party will not be complete without her attention to
detail, vision and aesthetic direction. What's more, her bouquets and
other pretty creations will do more than just impress. If you're in
London/UK then happiness can be delivered to you, is just a short
train ride away and can be found at That Flower Shop.

*Thank you 2012, you've been so kind to me.*
