Foals - Holy Fire

It's been a long time coming, but Foals are finally unveiling their
new album ['Holy Fire'](http://holyfire.foals.co.uk/), with its
official release date being the 11th of February 2013. This video for
their first single 'Inhaler' was directed by Dave Ma and the track is
arguably their strongest work to date. Foals have been able to
generate such incredible energy through their music time and time
again. Dedicated followers will be ecstatic to see them getting back
into the swing of things while those of you who become
infected/affected will wonder how you managed to miss this fantastic
five-piece in the past.
 
Earlier this year, Edwin Congreave of Foals cleverly put together a
selection of records to reflect the band members' eclectic tastes via
[!K7's 'Tapes' series](http://www.k7.com/foals-tapes/). This was a
well judged mixtape that only made me fall in love with Foals even
more.
