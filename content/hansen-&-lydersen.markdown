Hansen and Lydersen
 

Hansen & Lydersen Smoked Salmon made my Saturday morning brunch that much better. Actually, I don't remember having a bad breakfast or brunch for at least a year - Phew (especially as you can tell when I haven't been fed.. If I don't eat a proper breakfast, I won't be functioning and pretty much the whole day will be written off.. Hell hath no fury etc.)..
 

We got this from [Maltby Street Market](http://www.maltbystreet.com/) but the word on the street is that you can get it from [Broadway Market](http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/) too. You will find Hansen & Lydersen's smokehouse in Stoke Newington where the lovely Ole will happily inform you of the ins and outs of how, why and when he smokes his exquisite salmon. Failing that, you may also find some of his supplies at restaurants such as Viajante, NOPI and Sake No Hana, which speaks volumes.
