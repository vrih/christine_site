Sessun
[again](http://intotheglorybox.com/sessun-spring-summer-2012-collection.html). It
has been said that certain girls and boys in London are known to
possess a great sense of style. But, I would say that in countries
where the weather is not so warm and toasty, there's more of an
opportunity to get creative with the mixing, matching and layering.

Sessun style in London - Tres belle..

So as the days get colder, I urge you all to take note of Emma
Francois and her French label, with its perfect blend of retro yet
modern, cool but also classical feminine touch. For those of you who
live in regions where mild-moderate climates are not experienced, I'll
keep telling myself that I don't envy you at all.
