Citizen - Diva EP - Five Easy Pieces

So it's time for me to clean those filthy turntables of mine
again. Nothing new there then. The only thing stopping me from doing
so right now is this Diva EP by Citizen. Fresh from East London record
label, 'Five Easy Pieces', this release will make you stop what you're
doing while you immerse yourself deeply in its nostalgic tribute to
the one and only, Miss Irreplaceable - Whitney Houston. Citizen's own
style of experimental, bass-driven house and garage surprise
soundscapes are more than welcome in a world saturated with producers
who not only fail to add a personal touch to their compositions, but
also follow formulaic and predictable paths. After you've stopped what
you've been doing, be prepared to be moved by more carefully curated
content from 'Five Easy Pieces'.
