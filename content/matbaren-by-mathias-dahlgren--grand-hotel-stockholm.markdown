Stockholm - On the way to Matbaren by Mathias Dahlgren
 

Matbaren by Mathias Dahlgren at 'Grand Hotel Stockholm' was predictably marvelous. Our selection from the menu: Open sandwich of lamb with creamed spring mushrooms and gravy; Steamed beef buns with hot sauce and pickled cucumber; Egg 63 degrees centigrade and nettle cream with fried morels, white asparagus and fried onions; Yoghurt and blueberries with blueberry sorbet, honey and sea salt; Baked wild chocolate from Bolivia, sour cream, toffee ice cream and nuts. Need I say more?
