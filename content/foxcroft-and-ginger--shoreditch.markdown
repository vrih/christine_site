Foxcroft and Ginger - Shoreditch - Boxpark - London
 

Sweet memories of the Pommel Horse as well as browsing every magazine and newspaper in sight at Foxcroft and Ginger on Berwick Street, will always remain. How comforting it is to drink coffee from the same mismatched china and experience the ever warm welcoming atmosphere from the guys and girls at Foxcroft and Ginger - Boxpark, Shoreditch. Utterly delightful.
