Welcome to Corner Room

***Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This***
 
Everything about [The Corner Room](/tag/the-corner-room.html) reminds
me of the stuff that dreams are made of. In fact, every time I've gone
back to the Town Hall Hotel my experiences at this beautiful
neighbourhood bistro have been otherworldly. It starts from the moment
you walk past the Museum of Childhood. Just before reaching Patriot
Square, there's an unmistakable presence about this incredibly grand
and impressive building that draws you in.. so much so that many of us
have been compelled to visit on numerous occasions.
 

The delight is in the attention to detail here. Ingredients are often
taken out of their context and presented under a different
light. Equally as contributory to the success of dishes at Corner Room
is the inclusion of carefully sourced, high quality seasonal products,
prepared with the purpose of preserving their purity. If you subscribe
to Nuno Mendes' philosophy of showcasing ingredients with a creativity
that opens the senses, you'd be hard-pressed to find a restaurant that
does this better at such affordable prices.
 

In addition to The Corner Room, I would totally recommend the decadent
and exemplary Viajante Bar. This is my favourite bar in London and it
will leave you with a smile from ear to ear. Go here if you like your
cocktails clever, imaginative and perfect. Yet again, reminding me of
the stuff that dreams are made of...
