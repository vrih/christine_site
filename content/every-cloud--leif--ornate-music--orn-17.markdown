Leif - Ornate Music - ORN 017
 
'Every Cloud' by Leif, released via Ornate Music may be just what the doctor ordered. Leif caught my attention when he delivered that remix of Flori's 'Sing It Out' last year but it's almost as if he likes to leave us all hanging. On closer inspection, you'll find that he's been around, releasing material for over a decade. No surprises there then. Leif Knowles can be found at Freerotation Festival this summer and has an upcoming release via [Sudden Drop Records](http://clone.nl/all/label/sudden%20drop). We want more like this please, a lot more often.
