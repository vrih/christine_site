Capac - Pastels
 
 
This is what you need to be listening to right now. Can I call it a masterpiece? Well, it's currently 1am and I really need to lie down after the day, week, month I've just had, but this record just gets me so excited it might just keep me up for a while. Here they come, Capac, the beautiful ones.
