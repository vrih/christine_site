Rochelle Canteen
 
I can appreciate that banging on ad nauseum about my favourite restaurants doesn't excite everyone. Believe me, it's extremely toe-curling to think of oneself as a foodie hipster dork (no, no and no). But, for those who don't already know, Rochelle Canteen from Arnold & Henderson's team is where I'd go for my last meal.. I'm pretty sure many of you out there would like to do the same. Though I'm not sure when or whether they will serve 'Egg, Duck & Potato Cake', 'White Bean, Pumpkin & Goats Cheese', 'Lemon Posset & Blood Orange' again (and all on the same menu), I can and will always live in hope.
