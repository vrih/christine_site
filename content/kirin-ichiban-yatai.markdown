Kirin Ichiban Yatai
 
 
Last week, the joint owners of the superb [Yashin Bar and Restaurant](http://www.yashinsushi.com/), Yasuhiro Mineno - formerly the head chef of Nobu - and Shinya Ikeda set up shop at the Dray Walk Gallery, Truman Brewery. I promise you we didn't go there for the almost free beer. One thing's for sure, the Kushiage served was very good (for mopping up the alcohol too). 
 

The Kirin Ichiban Yatai has been and gone. But, there's no need to fret as Mineno and Ikeda will be launching their Kushiage style restaurant in 2012. The sooner, the better..
