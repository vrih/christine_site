Robag Wruhme's 'Thora Vukk' - Easy on the ears. 
 

As reviewed by [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=9024).
 

Robag Wruhme's mix for the [XLR8R podcast](http://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2011/05/robag-wruhme) is one to remember as it ['pieces together soothing, melodic pieces pulled from the far corners of the musical spectrum, be it experimenal ambient works, film scores, or symphonic classical pieces.'](http://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2011/05/robag-wruhme)
 
 
If I could listen to Robag's special version of Modeselektor & Thom Yorke's 'The White Flash' (29 minutes into the mix) before falling asleep every night, believe me, I would. As it stands, the original persists in my mind quite enough already and has consequently become a constant reminder that in actual fact, I don't ['have all the time in the world'. 'And the lights go out, and the stars are out'.. ](http://open.spotify.com/track/341C1nUuYGwlQOI8N5QLpB)
