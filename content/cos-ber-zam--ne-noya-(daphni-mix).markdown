Cos-Ber-Zam - Ne Noya (Daphni Mix) 
 

Daphni (Caribou's Dan Snaith) is making sure that Cos-Ber-Zam's 'Ne
Noya' becomes firmly ingrained into your mind.
 

You can catch the man himself alongside Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) and
James Holden on Wednesday 7th December at Scala, London. Together
they'll perform as part of the Caribou Vibration Ensemble, having done
so at ATP NYC in 2009.
