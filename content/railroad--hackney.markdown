Railroad - Hackney
 
In my hometown, there's this great little place that many of you will already have heard about. Railroad is one of many reasons why I'm finding myself back in Hackney more than I'd ever imagined. In fact, my other half and I have been considering the possibility of settling around there for a few years. Railroad cafe is definitely an incentive to do so and it's a perfect spot for relaxation on the weekends.
