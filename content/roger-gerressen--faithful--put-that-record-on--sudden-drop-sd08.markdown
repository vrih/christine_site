Roger Gerressen - Faithful / Put that record on - SD08
 
 
To appreciate this record, consider the work of Roger Gerressen,
Jocelyn Abell, Daniel Lekatompessy and Ivano Tetelepta of the
[ESHU collective](http://WWW.ESHURECORDS.COM/) in its
entirety. Gerressen's 'Faithful / Put that record on' via
[Sudden Drop records](http://clone.nl/all/label/sudden%20drop) has
proven to be a firm favourite amongst tastemakers in the
know. Delicately placed chords not only add a light touch to
'Faithful' but also reverberate throughout and within the mind, giving
it a beautifully soft sheen. It's not just about capturing that all
important groove though. Gerressen and his trusty companions have
taken it to a further level with ESHU records, rightfully putting
Nijmegen, Netherlands and its sounds onto the map of deeper
underground house and techno.
