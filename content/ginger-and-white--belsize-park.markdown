Ginger and White - Belsize Park
 
You already know how I feel about
[Ginger and White](http://www.intotheglorybox.com/ginger-and-white.html). But,
just in case you don't, you can now visit them in Belsize Park as well
as Perrins Court, Hampstead. Their brand new branch has successfully
managed to retain the same amount of charm that is already associated
with Ginger and White.
 
Most of my teenage years were spent in and around Hampstead as it was
handily located near the old school. Every so often, I take comfort in
venturing back to those same spots that I will always hold dear to
me. Even though years have passed by, there is something about this
area that will remain forever unchanged. I'd like to think that I'm
almost grown up now and at this point in time, I'm especially grateful
for the long-lasting friendships I've had. These old friends.. they're
the kindest, the most beautiful, often the funniest ones.. and this is
similar to how I feel about spending time in Ginger and White, where
there's so much warmth and graciousness.
