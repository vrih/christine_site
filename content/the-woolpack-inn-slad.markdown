The Woolpack Inn, Slad.

Southwest of Cheltenham, hidden in the Stroud district is the
quintessential English town of Painswick. If, like me, you're in need
of the occasional long country walk over the weekend then make your
way to the Cotswold valleys in Gloucestershire.

Oh [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1405766"), you are full of
great ideas and good finds. Staying at Mayfield Studio will get you
off to a strong start to discovering some of the surrounding areas
many delights, including the incredibly quaint
[Woolpack Inn](http://www.woolpackslad.co.uk/) in Slad.

Don't get me wrong, I am all for
[Antic Collective](http://anticlondon.com/) style pubs uncontrollably
cropping up all over London. I mean, one of the reasons and main
attractions of moving to (dare I say, "settling?") in Leytonstone was
down to the brilliant
[Red Lion](http://www.theredlionleytonstone.com/). On the other hand,
it is saddening to see certain pubs dying on their arses like it's
going out of fashion.

If more pubs were full of character, authenticity and strangely
attractive like The Woolpack Inn, I strongly believe they would stand
the true test of time and fierce competition. (Of course, there's a
lot more to it than that. Antic will probably be able to tell you
more).

Glossy plates of food with all their ingredients and components
retaining their natural colours just kept coming out of The Woolpack
kitchen. They did not disappoint, neither did the views overlooking
the undulating hills nor the knowledge that as much as I love London,
there are places like this I can escape to.

Other recommendations such as
[Stroud Farmers' Market](http://fresh-n-local.co.uk/trader/stroud/),
[The Butchers Arms (Sheepscombe)](http://www.butchers-arms.co.uk/) and
a wander around Cirencester serve as a testament to the quality of
life that can be experienced within surrounding areas. After spending
less than a few days and not enough nights there, I've come to the
conclusion that those who know, choose to live in the Cotswolds, where
the grass appears to be so much greener.
