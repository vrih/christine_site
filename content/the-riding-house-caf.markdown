The Riding House Cafe, London - Goats curd is the cure..

**Hot right now, later on and forever more**

Wow. So many beautiful people gathered in one place. If that was you
in The Riding House Café, well done. Of course, this isn't the only
reason why I've fallen in love with London's current favourite
brasserie. Everything is in its right place as soon as you step in -
chefs are hard at work in the open kitchen while the delightful staff
and an extremely charismatic Maitre d' keep things ticking over
smoothly.

My darling brother recently made a brave (and risky) move by changing
careers and moving to Singapore (Good on him and all those who have
the courage to make that move).  Last month he made a fleeting
appearance as he returned home, in between weddings outside
London. Due to the nature of my job, I only managed to see him for a
grand total of 6 hours, which wasn't too bad.. The Riding House Café
was really the only place I wanted to take him. Sometimes, I'm living
in the hope that I can make him see what he's missing out on so that
he'll come back home for good a lot sooner.  I have no doubt that The
Riding House Café served as a reminder that with its constant hunger
for more and at its best, there are few cities better than London.
