Love Lyrics By Amaru & Bhartri.Hari  
Translated by Greg Bailey & By Bilhana  
Edited and translated by Richard Gombrich
 
> "On her head jasmine, on her face a blossoming radiance,  
> On her body sandalwood stained with kunkum,  
> On her breast a slight lustful languidity, utterly lovely.  
> A piece of heaven has arrived."
 
The small and delightfully beautiful 'Gujarati Rasoi' restaurant is my
pick of the best bunch from the last few months. I can sense a whole
lot of love, dedication and commitment towards communicating their
central values through serving excellent traditional Indian food.
 
This is the kind of place that radiates warmth and charm whatever the
season may be. We had Papri Chaat, Thepla, and Binda, Butteta, Khaddi
ne Bhat - okra with potato slices, tempered with cumin, served with
rice and Khaddi - a savoury soup made with yoghurt, spices, ginger and
curry leaves. Check their weekly changing menu to find out more about
their main dishes. For dessert, Shrikhand balanced the meal nicely. A
simple and sensuous creamy pudding with cardamom, toasted pistachio
and saffron, served with Rava Puri, an Indian shortbread.
 
Find them at Borough Market on Friday and Saturday; Broadway market on
Saturday; Exmouth Market: Monday to Friday.
 
Visit the restaurant for lunch on Thursday and Friday from 12pm -
2:30pm or for dinner from 6pm - 10:30pm Wednesday to Saturday, or for
breakfast/brunch, coffee and chai on Saturday from 11am - 3pm.
