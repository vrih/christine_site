The White Lamp - 'Make It Good'

*The White Lamp - 'Make It Good' - Sonar Kollectiv*

Listen to
[more sweet sounds from The White Lamp](http://intotheglorybox.com/the-white-lamp-its-you-ron-basejam-remix.html)
as 'Make It Good' gets released next week via Sonar Kollectiv. The
Galactic Disco mix gets my full support and is sure to alert you to
the great work going on here. Now you know that The White Lamp is no
less than Darren Emerson from Underworld with Pete Josef on vocal
duties, you will no doubt be keeping yourself posted on
[future developments](http://soundcloud.com/the-white-lamp).
