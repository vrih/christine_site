'I Am Not A Doctor' is one of the many CD's I bought as a teenager. Having just finished my GCSE's, I took a trip to Hong Kong, where I discovered early Moloko in a well known record store. Years later, I was horrified to hear its stand-out track remixed into the version most of you will probably know of.
  
'Sing It Back', in its original and purest form is haunting and has a
timeless quality, which keeps me coming back to this song.
