Daughter - The Wild Youth EP

Now this is infused with all sorts of blissful sounds that go easy on
the ears. 'The Wild Youth EP' (via Communion Records) by Daughter has
been around for a year and always deserves another listen. If you're
lucky, you'll be able to catch Elena Tonra, Igor Haefeli and Remi
Aguilella in action. They'll be coming back to Europe, working their
way closer to Elena's hometown, where they'll be performing at the
Hackney Empire on the
[24th of January](http://www.communionmusic.co.uk/live/eventdetails/24-jan-13-daughter-hackney-empire/).

'Run' is the B-side to their most recent release (via 4AD and Glassnote) and shows that Daughter are up to their usual spellbinding tricks again.
