**Room Three, I will always have a soft spot for you. **
 
Many nights were spent here during my time at university. I still
remember walking home at 6am, admiring the beautiful sunrise over
St. Paul's Cathedral, on the way to East London. Fabric will never be
as good as it used to be. But, I have to hand it over to them for
maintaining a brand which will always stand for future-forward and
cutting edge music.
 
What I find extremely compelling is the
[Fabric/Fabric Live CD series](http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/fabric-products.html),
which is almost untouchable.
