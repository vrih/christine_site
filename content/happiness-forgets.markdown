Harry Palmer at Happiness Forgets
 
Suze, Rye Whiskey, Vermouth - I'll have some of that.
 

This is just what I needed to end the week - a Harry Palmer cocktail from Happiness Forgets in Shoreditch. Admittedly I was so mesmerised by the Gentlemen behind the bar, I spent most of the night watching in admiration as three brave men singlehandedly kept the crowd more than pleased for what seemed like hours.
