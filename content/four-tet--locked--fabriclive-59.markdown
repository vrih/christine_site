Four Tet - FABRICLIVE 59

  
Am I right in saying that Four Tet's recent SoundCloud stream of 'Locked', from his forthcoming mix for the untouchable FabricLive series and soon to be released single for his 'Text' Label, has gone viral?

Kieran Hebden has got the right idea and plenty of us will be able to relate to his clear love of music, obsessing over the finer details in life and delving into the depths of sounds that get us completely immersed.
