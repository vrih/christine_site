Their Acorda de Bacalhau breaded soup was divine.. Flinty Red's menu
is seasonal and daily-changing so I guess that means I'll have to find
a way to make it myself sometime soon. I've been craving some (as well
as everything else on their menu) since our visit to Bristol last
month. I've got my eye on a few recipes but the main ingredients are
dried cod fish, garlic, coriander, extra virgin olive oil, artisan
bread and eggs. I think it's time to book a short break to Portugal..
