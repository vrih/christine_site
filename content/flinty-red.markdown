Flinty Red
 

Restaurants like Flinty Red in Bristol make me want to punch the air in happiness. There wasn't a single item on the menu that we didn't want to try. As it's a daily changing menu, it's only a matter of time before we'll be back for more. It was a pity I had to drive there because it meant missing out on their marvellous selection of wines.
 
 
Flinty Red is a collaboration between chefs Matthew Williamson and Claire Thomson and the wine merchants Dominic Harman and Rachel Higgens of Corks of Cotham. For those of you who venture to this restaurant, you will no doubt experience flavoursome food from a creative and well thought out menu. On top of this, the staff are enthusiastic and passionate thereby creating a warm-hearted atmosphere, making the service truly outstanding.
 
 
Our favourites were the perfectly seasoned Acorda de Bacalhau - a classic bread soup with salt cod from Southern Portugal, confit ox cheek with pickled carrot, spring onion and mint, the delicate but also stunning beetroot leaf ravioli with marjoram and parmesan.. and to finish, salted caramel mousse, dark chocolate and ginger bread, which was gone in less than 60 seconds.
 
 
Thank you Flinty Red, because there was no place else I would rather have been that weekend.
