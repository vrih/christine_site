Machinedrum's final track 'Where Did We Go Wrong?' on his latest album
'Room(s)', due for release next Monday, will leave you in a solemn
mood. This is in stark contrast to the preceding 10 tracks which
contain a certain hyperactive energy.

[Machinedrum](http://machinedrum.net/) is Travis Stewart, that is, one
half of future sounding electronica champions
'[Sepalcure](http://www.intotheglorybox.com/sepalcure.html)'. The
following examples (Spotify links below) will give you a good idea of
how slick his production skills are. Teamed with Praveen Sharma, the
duo are unbeatable.
