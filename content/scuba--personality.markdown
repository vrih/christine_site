Scuba - The Hope - Personality
 
After 'The Hope' comes the much anticipated album 'Personality' due for release on February 27th. Anyone who knows me well will remember my incessant need to promote the work of Paul Rose and his Hotflush label way back when it was 2008 and relatively unknown. This is a man who is able to sense the direction in which the wind will blow, way before the rest of us. Let's face it, his ability to detect and sign some of the most talented electronic music producers was never going to go unnoticed. It's no wonder his hard work is paying off as Hotflush has reached almost cult status. 
 
'Tulips' and 'Cognitive Dissonance' from 'Personality' are my picks of the day. 
 
'A thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever' (John Keats), comes to mind and is most certainly applicable here. Enjoy.
