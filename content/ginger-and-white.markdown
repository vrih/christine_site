Ginger & White

  
**Ginger and White - I choose you** 
 
 
My all time favourite coffee shop in London. Hidden on a narrow little
side street in the magically enchanting area of Hampstead, Ginger and
White is a stylish place to kiss your worries away.
 

You'll find classic breakfast and brunch dishes made with quality
ingredients from quality suppliers. I like to keep it simple with soft
boiled eggs and marmite soldiers. Coffee beans are supplied by
[Square Mile Coffee Roasters](http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/), who
rightfully have a cult following.
 

Ginger and White was conceptualised by food stylist Tonia George and
restaurant consultants Emma and Nicholas Scott. What a feeling it must
be to see Ginger and White on a busy day (often the case), achieving
exactly what they set out to do, and more. I have so much admiration
for the team who run this coffee shop because it is a dream come true.
 

I initially fell in love with Ginger and White during my first visit,
a year ago. Because the coffee shop was full to the brim with
customers, we were kindly offered a table outside by a very lovely
lady. Being a typical spring day last year, it was fairly nippy. Cue
Ginger and White to the rescue with their warming blankets, hot
chocolate, coffee and cake. We were eventually moved inside where I
spent the remainder of the afternoon in adoration of everything Ginger
and White is about. It's a coffee shop I return to over and over
again. The little ones love it too.. so I dream of future Sundays to
come, spent with the love of my life (and our family) in the beautiful
Ginger and White.
