*Sessun - Spring/Summer 2012 Collection*
 

This is what I seek out when separating the wheat from the chaff: a fine selection of materials &gt; patterns &gt; textures &gt; colours &gt; attention to detail.. At the end of a wander through London, a shop assistant politely asked whether I was able to find everything I was looking for today. The truth is, I'm finding it increasingly time consuming having to sort through most of what is on offer from the majority of our high street brands and rejecting almost every item - almost to the point where I'm close to giving up. Although it wouldn't be the end of the world, I'm pretty sure this wasn't happening as often in previous years. Seasons change and something inside me keeps on hoping for the quality of designs and cuts of clothing to improve exponentially. 
 

In reality, there are only a handful of brands that go from strength to strength. Emma Francois is the designer of Sessun - a brand that is well organised, clean, and a cut above the rest. Without Sessun, I wouldn't have been able to find what I was looking for. As the search goes on to discover more brands like this, I'm sure plenty of girls (and boys) will be making a note of Sessun to add to that all important list of those who never compromise on their values, character and craftsmanship.
