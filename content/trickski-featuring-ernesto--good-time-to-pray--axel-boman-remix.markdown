Trickski featuring Ernesto - Good Time To Pray
 
So this is how the story goes: I've been running on adrenalin lately
and quite frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. La vita e bella
at this point in time and there are plenty of reasons to be
cheerful. Bear in mind, I get by with a little help from all the
energy gained through listening to as many perfect sounds of this
universe as I can find. Very rarely do I find myself feeling
unmotivated or bored, which is why I find it fairly difficult to
relate to people who appear to be flagging, half-arsed and bummed
out. A little music sure goes a long way to inject a lot of soul into
you.

Having recently seen the extremely competent and accomplished
[Sven Weisemann](http://www.svenweisemann.com/) DJ-ing in the basement
of Take Five Cafe, Bristol ('twas a great night by SUM and Idle
Hands), I've been madly keen on his overall style and sound. To get an
idea of his selection, think 'Genius of Time', 'Vakula', 'FaltyDL' and
'Dorisburg' to name a few.. Prior to this, I'd also been keeping an
eye on the label 'Aniara Recordings' for some time.. so to cut a long
story short.. one thing led to another.. and the result is that I'm
listening to lot of
[Axel Boman](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/axelboman).
 
Listen to Axel Boman's remix of Trickski's 'Good Time To Pray'
featuring Ernesto. He's managed to add more than just a touch of
warmth and sophistication. It's sounds like this that keep me going
and I'm pretty sure at least a whole dance floor full of people would
not disagree.
