Gelupo London
  
I've lost count of the number of times we've stopped off at Gelupo
London and taken our own sweet time browsing through all the goodies
on offer. The gelateria and delicatessen is conveniently located
opposite my favourite Italian restaurant in London - Bocca di Lupo
([previous post to be found here](http://www.intotheglorybox.com/bocca-di-lupo.html)). Ricotta
and sour cherry gelato is the cure.
 

Take a look at
[this cookbook by Bocca's Jacob Kennedy](https://gelupogelateria.com/product_info.php?cPath=38_76&products_id=380). At
least two of you out there will be receiving this from me for
Christmas.. so I'll be expecting the standards of any future dinner
parties to fly through the roof in 2012..
