When the sun goes down and the party’s over, this is the track you’ll
be playing to keep you suspended between that state of heightened
senses and "almost ready to return back to reality" feeling. Veteran
acid house producer Johannes Auvinen gets it just right with “No New
Violence” and “Depleted Serotonin”, especially when it’s necessary to
silence the silence.
