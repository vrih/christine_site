**Ben Pearce - What I Might Do - Harry Wolfman Remix **
 

Ben Pearce has managed to do what many producers have strived to and
much more. With an impressive CV and mountains of experience under his
belt, his forthcoming EP
'[What I Might Do](http://soundcloud.com/mtarecords/ben-pearce-what-i-might-do-6)'
is set to become one of the biggest club anthems of the year. It was
only a matter of time before the
[remixes](http://soundcloud.com/mtarecords/ben-pearce-what-i-might-do-3)
started materialising.  Harry Wolfman of Wolfstock Events has made
this valuable contribution, diluting what was an enormously catchy
tune into a healthier and more manageable dose of serious prime audio
soup.
