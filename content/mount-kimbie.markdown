These boys have bags of talent and it was immediately obvious the
moment I heard one of their tracks on
[Ramadanman's Dubwar Podcast](http://www.dqxt.org/dubwar/podcast/dubwar_podcast_05_ramadanman.mp3)
back in 2008. I remember waiting for 'William' and 'Maybes' to be
released on Vinyl. What a great day that was. They've come so far now
and it just keeps on getting better for them.
