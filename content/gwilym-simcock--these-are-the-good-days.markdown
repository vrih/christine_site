Back in the good old bad old days, it was all about the Mercury music
prize. I'm talking about the late 90's. Then it all got slightly
silly.. This year, however, I'm glad to see Gwilym Simcock's latest
album 'Good Days at Schloss Elmau' up for nomination.


[In this video from The Guardian website](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2011/aug/18/gwilym-simcock-these-good-days-video),
Gwilym will give you reasons to celebrate The
[Barclaycard Mercury Prize](http://www.mercuryprize.com/) competition,
which champions recorded music of a variety of genres by British or
Irish artists.
