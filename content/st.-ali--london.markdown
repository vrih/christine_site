St.ALi - London
 
I can't live without coffee shops like St.ALi. 
 

Clerkenwell...Farringdon...London, England, you got lucky when St.ALi opened their sister branch earlier this year. You can really feel the buzz amongst the staff in here as business is booming, supreme coffee is being roasted on the premises and brunch is being whipped up at all times. Now that they're open in the evenings, there's no doubt we'll all be frequenting St.ALi that much more.
