Polaroid by Lina Scheynius

 
When I think about the story of Lina Scheynius, I am in constant awe. We encounter countless numbers of images during our lifetime. Some are deleted instantly and become erased from the mind. Sometimes a gentle reminder is required before we can recall the moment we laid eyes on an image. At other times, you might come across a body of work that lingers on forever. The photographic work of Lina Scheynius falls into this latter category.
 


Scheynius herself has confessed that when she first started posting her photographs on the internet, she had not predicted the impact it would have on her life. In my mind, artists who are connected to their craft intuitively, wholeheartedly and honestly will always hold the competitive edge. Scheynius does this with style and grace. What's more, she also demonstrates authenticity and longevity, two traits repeatedly identified as being necessary for long-term success.
 


Currently residing in London, Scheynius was born in Sweden and grew up in Trollhatten. Her work is as personal as it is public. Although Scheynius has edited her choice of images for presentation, what you see before your eyes are examples of close enough to perfect composition. There is no retouching here. No cropping either. This is rawness translated into beauty, at its best.
 


I have the utmost admiration for Scheynius as she tastefully exposes parts of her world to us with extreme courage and transparency. Her photographs tell a story of loves, both past and present. The facial expressions she has managed to capture just persist and endure. The selection of interior spaces and the utilisation of light is impeccable. These are photographs that reward the viewer the closer they are inspected. Ultimately, the images uncover fragments of an intensely beautiful mind.
 


I can't help but feel uplifted by Scheynius' photography. After all, to be exhibiting work that is both subtle plus naturally uninhibited is no mean feat and the results of her efforts are a true gift to us. The opportunity to view these images away from the computer screen should not be missed and may just provide the nudge for those shying away from documenting those moments that are knowingly or unknowingly taken for granted, to make better use of the camera.
