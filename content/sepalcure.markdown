Sepalcure are masters of good music production. They are consistent in delivering polished and intelligent futuristic sounding electronic music. Both members of Sepalcure are highly experienced in the game and it shows. 
 

[Boomkat describes Fleur - EP as 'spellbinding'. ](http://boomkat.com/vinyl/375249-sepalcure-fleur)They're not wrong. [LWE](http://www.littlewhiteearbuds.com/review/download-of-the-week-sepalcure-feeling-that-i-know-so-well/), [RCRD.LBL](http://rcrdlbl.com/2010/07/09/download_sepalcure_feeling_that_i_know_so_well) and [XLR8R](http://www.xlr8r.com/mp3/2010/07/feeling-i-know-so-well) made 'Feeling That I Know So Well' available for listening pleasure last summer and since then, I've been in awe of Sepalcure, keeping a close eye and ear on what they'll do next. 
 

When I was a little girl, I wondered what music might sound like in the future. The future is now, and Sepalcure are making music that is exactly how I always imagined it should and would sound.
