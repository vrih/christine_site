This is a selection from a photo shoot, featuring Mischa Barton, shot by the magnificent [Jen Carey](http://www.jencarey.com/). Much of this exudes classical beauty, which I favour from time to time. What I really like is that subtle edgy quality seen here and in Jen Carey's other work - most certainly not easy to pull off, yet this has been achieved consistently and with perfect aplomb. 
 

The styling is by Rachel Bakewell and includes dresses, coats and boots from Vintage Modes, Karl Lagerfeld, [Miharayasuhiro](http://www.miharayasuhiro.jp/) and Alexander McQueen at Matches.
