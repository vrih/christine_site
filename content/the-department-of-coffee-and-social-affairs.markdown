The Department of Coffee and Social Affairs
 
Seriously good looking, beautifully and naturally lit, The Department of Coffee and Social Affairs is my favourite coffee shop in Clerkenwell. It's probably not a competition, but there are some coffee shops within the vicinity that might pose a little threat. Nonetheless, The Department of Coffee comes out on top and pips others to the post. There's something about its atmosphere.. so calm, so cool and the staff - so collected. 
 

They've just got it right with a great balance of sweet and savoury foods / coffee, tea and hot chocolate / art, design and music.  It's amazing how much spending an hour with your favourite person in a coffee shop like this can make the world seem like a perfect place, although that might have something to do with the caramel slice I had.
 

I'm gutted that this place closes at 5pm. If you're a whole lot better than me at waking up super early, and I suspect most of you are, then grab your quality early morning coffee here as it's open at 07.00 on weekdays and 10.00 on weekends. 
 
 
[Note: Since writing this post, the opening hours have been extended to 6pm Monday-Friday]
