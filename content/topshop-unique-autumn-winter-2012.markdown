In my ideal world, this is how I would envision the majority of you to
present yourselves. It's almost as if the designers at Topshop Unique
have read my mind as they've delivered a collection that will be
wished for longingly, months before it even hits the shops. It must be
the tasteful combination of khaki, grey, off-white, navy, burnt orange
and burgundy, along with the most appealing array of enticing
patterns, materials and textures that've got me going mmmmmm.. So what
if everybody dressed the same, in this Topshop Unique Autumn Winter
2012 collection, we'd never get tired of looking at each other..
