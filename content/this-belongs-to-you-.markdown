This is all for you
 

You may or may not know that I've been away from home for what seems like forever and a million days. Jonah Lehrer once said that 'Distance and difference are the secret tonic of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But, something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything.' Don't get me wrong - what I've learnt over the last 3 years has been of great value but there are times when it feels like being everywhere and trying everything ultimately amounts to belonging nowhere and tasting nothing.
 

They say you can take a girl out of London but you can't take London out of the girl. I realised this was pretty damn true quite soon after I left. Now that I'm home again, there's a sense of heightened awareness and extra appreciation for the things I love most about this city and its people.
 

I can share the following with you:
 

The photos (in conjunction with the list below) represent some of the last 6 months.

As for the rest, I'm still working that out. I hope I can stay here for a while but, I'm prepared to go wherever I need to as long as it expands my mind. For now though, here's to London and the rest of 2012.
