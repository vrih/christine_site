Allow me to introduce you to [Roost](http://www.roostblog.com/) by Caitlin Van Horn. A year ago, I asked her for permission to write a small feature on what I believe is an outstandingly beautiful blog. What I find most remarkable is the way she has communicated her story with such sincerity and so elegantly. By eliminating all grain and processed sugar from the diet, she has been successful in managing her husband's Crohn's disease naturally. Her unfaltering faith in eating seasonally and locally, as well as her desire to spread this philosophy and way of life is admirable. Roost is where you would escape to if you want to find [blood orange, prosecco and thyme sorbet](http://www.roostblog.com/roost/blood-orange-prosecco-thyme-sorbet.html/); [Riesling poached pear tart with chai spiced custard](http://www.roostblog.com/roost/riesling-poached-pear-tart-with-chai-spiced-custard-almond-c.html); [butternut squash and hazelnut bouchons with toasted nutmeg ice cream](http://www.roostblog.com/roost/butternut-squash-hazelnut-bouchons-with-toasted-nutmeg-ice-c.html); [hazelnut honey cake](http://www.roostblog.com/roost/hazelnut-honey-cake-with-spiced-cranberry-chutney.html) or [brown butter strawberry cake with Swiss meringue cream](http://www.roostblog.com/roost/an-anniversary-brown-butter-strawberry-cake-with-swiss-merin.html). The ideas and possibilities are endless. So this leaves me to say it comes as no great surprise that her first publication is due in Spring 2014. Caitlin, I know you have a soft spot for all things English. It's only fair that I return some warmth and appreciation to you from this small part of the world.
